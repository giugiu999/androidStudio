# Lab 06 Participation Exercise

Proper completion of this exercise is considered as part of course participation.

In this exercise your task is to **implement and test** the following methods in the CityList class **AND create Javadocs** for the main source files (not tests):

1) Implement and test these methods:
    
      **hasCity(City city)**
        - When given a city, return whether or not it belongs in the list.<br> 
        - Test to see whether your method is correct.
          
      **delete(City city)**
        - Check if a city is present in the list. If it does then remove it from the list, if not then **throw an exception**.<br> 
        - Test to see if your method removes it from the list.<br> 
        - Test to see if the exception is thrown.
          
      **countCities()**
        - Return how many cities are on the list.<br> 
        -  Test to see whether your method is correct.
        
2) Add Javadocs to all methods in the CityList class and City class **AND** generate the javadocs to **code/javadocs/**
